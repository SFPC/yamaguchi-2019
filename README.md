# Themes

Technology as a gift

Can we approach technology as a gift? For SFPC Summer 2019 in Yamaguchi, we are approaching technology and specifically computation as an expression of gratitude and care for each other. Technology doesn't have to be made by corporations. However, it's rare to find technology made for a friend as a form of gift. Through hands-on coding, hacking, playing, poetry writing, students will make gifts for each other. Students will learn about the philosophy and practice of poetic computation, a set of tools to continue their creative practice and teach others after the one week program.


Curriculum as a gift

We will create a social dynamic for generosity amongst teachers, students and staff. We will share what have we learned from the first six years of running SFPC. We will share the ideas and technologies that our teachers and students have been developing. We hope to inspire the students to start their own schools, studios or collectives after the program.
